            <p>Auslan is always evolving, but thanks to the feedback
            we receive from the Auslan-using community through Signbank, you will be able 
            to help shape the language. We invite you to pass on any comments you 
            may have, or to suggest corrections and additions to Signbank.</p>
            
            <p>All comments are welcome and any information you give us about 
            Auslan will be taken into consideration and properly evaluated. 
            However, due to the large number of registered users, we do not 
            acknowledge receipt of comments, nor are we able to provide 
            answers to specific questions about Auslan.</p>

            <p>Please consult the <a href="/about/help/">help page</a> for system 
            requirements for 
            viewing this site. However, because access to Auslan Signbank 
            is free, we do not have the resources to offer you individual 
            technical support regarding your computer or its operating system, 
            your internet connection, or your browser.</p>

            <p>We thank you in advance for your contribution and cooperation.</p>
